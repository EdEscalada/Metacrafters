# Assessment

The program is to provide a demonstration on writing a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it with added functionalities

## Description

The objective is to create and deploy an ERC20 token on the Avalanche network for Degen Gaming, incorporating functionalities such as minting new tokens by the owner, transferring tokens between players, redeeming tokens for in-game items, checking token balances, and burning tokens that are no longer needed. The smart contract will be written in Solidity, utilizing OpenZeppelin contracts for secure and standard implementations, and deployed using Hardhat. This project aims to enhance player engagement and loyalty by integrating blockchain technology into the gaming ecosystem, providing a seamless and rewarding experience for players.
