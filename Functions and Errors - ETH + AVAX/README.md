# assessment

The program is to provide a demonstration on revert, assert and require functionality on contracts.

## Description

The program will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply). Then have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value, which increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance of the address by that amount. A burn function is also included, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It can also transfer tokens from one account to another.
