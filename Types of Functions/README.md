# Assessment

The program is to provide a demonstration on writing a smart contract to create your own ERC20 token and deploy it with few basic functions.

## Description

This project involves creating an ERC20 token smart contract using Solidity and deploying it with Hardhat. The contract owner has the ability to mint tokens to a specified address, while any user can burn and transfer tokens. The project demonstrates the fundamental principles of token creation, ownership, and interaction on the Ethereum blockchain.
